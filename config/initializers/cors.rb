# CORS Configuration
#
# CORS is configured in config/application.rb
# 
# Current allowed origins:
# - rs-test.net (with and without www)
# - reportify.rs-development.net
# - localhost:3000 (for development)
# - localhost:5173 (for Vite dev server)
#
# If you need to add more origins, edit config/application.rb
# and redeploy with: bin/deploy.production
#
# Security note: CORS is set to allow credentials (cookies, auth headers)
# which is necessary for JWT authentication to work properly.
